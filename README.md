### Chatbot-Watson-Assistant
I created a control panel for the robot base using HTML, CSS. The base contains a control panel that includes four directions in addition to the stop button. Also, it has a bot that can interact with Arabic and English based on the user choice. What the bot provides is to enable the user to know ways to communicate with the support service to help him solve his problems
